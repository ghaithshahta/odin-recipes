    <h2>Slow Cooker Chipotle Chili</h2>
    <p>My friend Keni's love of smoky chipotle peppers inspired this chili recipe. It comes together easily in the slow cooker and is a unique chili that always stands out. It is a spicy yet mellow chili that gives a kick without the lingering burn, like many chilis do.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and sausage in the hot skillet until some of the fat.</li>
        <li>Stir kidney beans, chili beans, diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, celery, bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Cook until vegetables are tender and celery retains a slight bite, 6 to 8 hours on Low or 3 to 4 hours on High.</li>
    </ol>
